      "Visual inspection of electrical panel(s), wiring, grounding, outlets, and all accessible circuits.",
      "Identify hazards: exposed or uninsulated wiring, open panels, missing covers, improper splicing, overloaded circuits, outdated service, or visible corrosion.",
      "Check for code violations or unpermitted work.",
